# Dasher
This repository is for a game I made called Dasher. Dasher is a 2D platformer where you play as a DashDoorer and you need to platform through the level in order to get to the goal and deliver the food. The game right now is only one level but there are plans to work on it more and add more levels. 

How To Play and Input
The character moved with just two buttons the W or UP arrow keys will allow the player to jump, the D or RIGHT arrow keys will allow the player to moe to the rightof the screen. There is also a hidden movement mechanic that must be figured out and utilized in order to make it through the level. There is also a timer, you have 1 minute and 30 seconds to mkae it through the level. Good Luck and have fun!
